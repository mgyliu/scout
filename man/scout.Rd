\usage{
scout(
  x,
  y,
  newx = NULL,
  p1 = 2,
  p2 = 1,
  lam1s = seq(0.001, 0.2, len = 10),
  lam2s = seq(0.001, 0.2, len = 10),
  rescale = TRUE,
  trace = FALSE,
  standardize = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of predictors, where the rows are the samples and
the columns are the predictors}

\item{y}{A matrix of observations, where length(y) should equal nrow(x)}

\item{newx}{An *optional* argument, consisting of a matrix with
ncol(x) columns, at which one wishes to make predictions for each
(lam1,lam2) pair.}

\item{p1}{The $L_p$ penalty for the covariance regularization. Must be
one of 1, 2, or NULL. NULL corresponds to no covariance
regularization.  WARNING: When p1=1, and ncol(x)>500, Scout can be
SLOW. We recommend that for very large data sets, you use Scout with
p1=2. Also, when ncol(x)>nrow(x) and p1=1, then very small values of
lambda1 (lambda1 < 1e-4) will cause problems with graphical lasso,
and so those values will be automatically increased to 1e-4.}

\item{p2}{The $L_p$ penalty for the estimation of the regression
coefficients based on the regularized covariance matrix. Must be one
of 1 (for $L_1$ regularization) or NULL (for no regularization).}

\item{lam1s}{The (vector of) tuning parameters for regularization of the
covariance matrix. Can be NULL if p1=NULL, since then no covariance
regularization is taking place. If p1=1 and nrow(x)<ncol(x), then the no value in lam1s
should be smaller than 1e-3, because this will cause graphical lasso
to take too long. Also, if ncol(x)>500 then we really do not
recommend using p1=1, as graphical lasso can be uncomfortably slow.}

\item{lam2s}{The (vector of) tuning parameters for the $L_1$ regularization of
the regression coefficients, using the regularized covariance
matrix. Can be NULL if p2=NULL. (If p2=NULL, then non-zero lam2s
have no effect). A value of 0 will result in no
regularization.}

\item{rescale}{Should coefficients beta obtained by
covariance-regularized regression be re-scaled by a constant, given
by regressing $y$ onto $x beta$? This is done in Witten and
Tibshirani (2008) and is important for good performance. Default is
TRUE.}

\item{trace}{Print out progress? Prints out each time a lambda1 is
completed. This is a good idea, especially when
ncol(x) is large.}

\item{standardize}{Should the columns of x be scaled to have standard deviation
1, and should y be scaled to have standard deviation 1, before
covariance-regularized regression is performed? This affects the
meaning of the penalties that are applied. In general,
standardization should be performed. Default is TRUE.}

\value{
* intercepts - Returns a matrix of intercepts, of dimension
               length(lam1s) x length(lam2s)
* coefficients - Returns an array of coefficients, of dimension
                 length(lam1s) x length(lam2s) x ncol(x)
* p1 - p1 value used
* p2 - p2 value used

\description{
The main function of the "scout" package. Performs
covariance-regularized regression. Required inputs are an x matrix of
features (the columns are the features) and a y vector of
observations. By default, Scout(2,1) is performed; however, $p_1$ and
$p_2$ can be specified (in which case Scout($p_1$, $p_2$) is
performed). Also, by default Scout is performed over a grid of lambda1
and lambda2 values, but a different grid of values (or individual
values, rather than an entire grid) can be specified.
