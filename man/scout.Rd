\title{Covariance-regularized regression, aka the Scout.}
\description{
The main function of the "scout" package. Performs
covariance-regularized regression. Required inputs are an x matrix of
features (the columns are the features) and a y vector of
observations. By default, Scout(2,1) is performed; however, $p_1$ and
$p_2$ can be specified (in which case Scout($p_1$, $p_2$) is
performed). Also, by default Scout is performed over a grid of lambda1
and lambda2 values, but a different grid of values (or individual
values, rather than an entire grid) can be specified.
}
\usage{
scout(x,y,newx,p1=2,p2=1,lam1s=seq(.001,.2,len=10),lam2s=seq(.001,.2,len=10),
   rescale=TRUE, trace=TRUE,standardize=TRUE, alternateCov=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A matrix of predictors, where the rows are the samples and
    the columns are the predictors}
  \item{y}{A matrix of observations, where length(y) should equal
    nrow(x)}
  \item{newx}{An *optional* argument, consisting of a matrix with
    ncol(x) columns, at which one wishes to make predictions for each
    (lam1,lam2) pair.}
  \item{p1}{The $L_p$ penalty for the covariance regularization. Must be
  one of 1, 2, or NULL. NULL corresponds to no covariance
  regularization.  WARNING: When p1=1, and ncol(x)>500, Scout can be
  SLOW. We recommend that for very large data sets, you use Scout with
  p1=2. Also, when ncol(x)>nrow(x) and p1=1, then very small values of
  lambda1 (lambda1 < 1e-4) will cause problems with graphical lasso,
and so those values will be automatically increased to 1e-4. }
  \item{p2}{The $L_p$ penalty for the estimation of the regression
    coefficients based on the regularized covariance matrix. Must be one
  of 1 (for $L_1$ regularization) or NULL (for no regularization).}
  \item{lam1s}{The (vector of) tuning parameters for regularization of the
    covariance matrix. Can be NULL if p1=NULL, since then no covariance
    regularization is taking place. If p1=1 and nrow(x)<ncol(x), then the no value in lam1s
    should be smaller than 1e-3, because this will cause graphical lasso
    to take too long. Also, if ncol(x)>500 then we really do not
    recommend using p1=1, as graphical lasso can be uncomfortably slow.}
  \item{lam2s}{The (vector of) tuning parameters for the $L_1$ regularization of
    the regression coefficients, using the regularized covariance
    matrix. Can be NULL if p2=NULL. (If p2=NULL, then non-zero lam2s
    have no effect). A value of 0 will result in no
    regularization. }
  \item{rescale}{Should coefficients beta obtained by
    covariance-regularized regression be re-scaled by a constant, given
    by regressing $y$ onto $x beta$? This is done in Witten and
    Tibshirani (2008) and is important for good performance. Default is
    TRUE.}
  \item{trace}{Print out progress? Prints out each time a lambda1 is
    completed. This is a good idea, especially when
    ncol(x) is large.}
  \item{standardize}{Should the columns of x be scaled to have standard deviation
    1, and should y be scaled to have standard deviation 1, before
    covariance-regularized regression is performed? This affects the
    meaning of the penalties that are applied. In general,
    standardization should be performed. Default is TRUE.}
  \item{alternateCov}{Choose an alternate covariance estimator to use. Defaults
    to NULL, in which case `stats::cov` is used. Choose from "mcd", "mve",
    "cellwise".}
}
\value{
  \item{intercepts}{Returns a matrix of intercepts, of dimension length(lam1s)xlength(lam2s)}
  \item{coefficients}{Returns an array of coefficients, of dimension
    length(lam1s)xlength(lam2s)xncol(x).}
  \item{p1}{p1 value used}
  \item{p2}{p2 value used}
  \item{lam1s}{lam1s used}
  \item{lam2s}{lam2s used}

  When p1=1 and ncol(x)>500 or so, then Scout can be very slow!!
  Please use p1=2 when ncol(x) is large.
